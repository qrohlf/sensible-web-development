overview:
  By popular demand, this Thursday will be extended office hours. If you are behind (you don't have Lab 2 finished), please come to class with one or two **specific** things that you want help with. Please note that there is still a lab assigned this week - I want you to get used to continuously iterating on and improving your app in preperation for the project portion of this class.

reading:
  "Recommended reading - review any of the previous chapters that you had trouble with, as well as the [suggested resources](/chapters/3/1-additional-help.html) for those topics. Optional reading - [this StackOverFlow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered)"

due:
  You should have [Lab 1](/chapters/1/0-up-and-running.html#assignment) completed by the end of class. I would like to see everyone have Lab 3 finished by next Thursday (October 2nd).

workshop:
  TBD
